# C-OpenGL-3D-Engine

### C++ and OpenGL 3D Engine using SDL window and input manager, GLM Math library.
> GLM simplifies matrix operations such as rotation/translation/scaling and creating projection matrices.
> SDL simplifies making and updating the window, and getting user input either mouse or keyboard.
> C++ was chosen to see if preformance would be better than my other project GEngine3D using Java & LWJGL
> I chose openGL because of previous experience with it.
